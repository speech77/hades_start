# Modules
- Offload (`Scarico`) at MAX for your level
- Shipment drone (`Drone da carico`) at MAX for your level
- Trade boost (`Potenziamento commercio`)
- Trade burst (`Potenziamento commercio`)
- Cargo bay extension (`Ampliamento stiva`) at MAX for your level

# Space stations
- Warp lane hub (`Hub corsia warp`) at MAX (number and level) for your level
- Trade station (`Stazione di scambio`) at MAX (number and level) for your level



# Transport ship

## Shipment transport ship
(minimum x3)

- Offload (`Scarico`)
- Trade boost (`Potenziamento commercio`)
- Trade burst (`Potenziamento commercio`)
- Cargo bay extension (`Ampliamento stiva`)

## Drone transport ship
- Shipment drone (`Drone da carico`)



# Star setup
The target is to set up warp lanes to consume hydrogen as low as possible.  
Also you should have 1 Trade station (`Stazione di scambio`) as close as possible to a big planet (40 shipments at least).

- red lines: optimized Warp lanes
- red stars: Trade station (`Stazione di scambio`)
- red start yellow circled: the Trade station (`Stazione di scambio`) where to offload shipments to 



# The trick

## Rename all planets connected by warp lanes
- rename all planets connected by the Warp lane hub (`Hub corsia warp`), placing an `*` in the beginning (ex: `*Julmar`)  
- now you would see an `*` on all shipments for those planets too

From planet shipments overview, you can now sort shipments by name and get on top (or bottom) shipments with `*`. 

## Send one Transport on each zone
- send one Transport (or two) on each zone OUTSIDE the Warp lane hub (`Hub corsia warp`)
- load ALL the shipments from those planets
- bring them on planets into the Warp lane hub (`Hub corsia warp`)
- DROP there shipments whit `*` (let the Shipment drone (`Drone da carico`) make deliveries for you)
- LOAD all shipments with NO `*` (not drone deliverable)
- bring shipments with NO `*` to the big planet close to the `red start yellow circled` (image above)
- look for a Transport ship with modules active (Offload (`Scarico`) and 2x Trade bonuses)
- shuttle and offload all shipments with NO `*` to the `yellow circled` Trade station (`Stazione di scambio`) WITH just one Transport ship
- turn on Time modulator to speed up travelling

In this way you can have:
- drone bonus on `*` shipments
- trade bonuses on NO `*` shipments
- all planets empty of shipments
- low hydrogen consumption
- low time to get a full shipment round
